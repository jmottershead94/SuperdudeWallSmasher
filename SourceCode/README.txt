Directory structure
===================
-> The zip file contains the ".swf" file which can be
   played through a web browser if you wish.

-> The "FlashDevelop_Files" folder contains all of the 
   development assets used to create the Flash game.
		- Inside this folder are the usual FlashDevelop
		  directories: bin, src etc.
		- There is a folder labelled "Game Sprites" which
		  contains all of art assets used within the game.
				- This folder contains references, images which
				I used as a reference to draw my sprites from.
				- As well as a folder called Exported PNG Images,
				this contains all of the sprites that I exported
				from "GIMP", so that I could use them in my
				Flash levels, titlescreens etc. 
		- The "Sounds" folder contains the two sound effects
		  that I deemed useful for my game project. I have
		  edited these two sounds into one sound file for the
		  sound effect that I wanted, this file can be located
		  in the "Resources" file under the "src" file.
		- The "src" folder contains the ActionScript files for
		  the games, which handles all of the code.
				- The "FlashDocuments" folder contains all of the
				  ".fla" files from Adobe Flash. Such as level
				  backgrounds, player animation etc.
				- The "Resources" folder contains the previously
				  mentioned "Collapsing_Wall" sound clip.
   - The rest of the files listed here are the exported 
     flash documents which are converted to ".swc" files,
	 in order to gain access to the different elements
	 in the flash documents.
	 
Instructions
============
-> I would appreciate if you play the ".swf" file in your browser,
   if you could minimise the window because I did not accommodate
   background and the levels are all designed with this "safe zone"/
   screen area in mind.
-> Otherwise, you can access the code directly in FlashDevelop and 
   compile the files in the software package.
-> As for controls for the game, there is a button on the main menu
   that will take you to the controls page, and this page will explain
   how the game works, and the only control is the left mouse button.
   HOWEVER, to play the game, you have to place the cursor over the
   momentum bar, and click as fast as you can.
-> There is a high score system in place, which will be kept in the
   game, until you close the game window itself. Then it will be reset.
